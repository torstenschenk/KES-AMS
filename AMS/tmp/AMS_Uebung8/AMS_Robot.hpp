/// This header-file defines the aggregation class "AMS_Robot",
/// which can be used to control a simulated or a real robot
/// equipped with a differential drive and a laser sensor.
/// The class implements a position2d- and a ranger-interface within
/// the player-framework, and can be used to change or to read state
/// parameters of the robot.
/// In case of a simulated robot also some methods for plotting
/// within the "stage"-window using graphic2d-proxies are available.
/// Further, the class provides a number of higher-lever methods for
/// robot navigation and it implements an error model assuming slipping.
/// The class evaluates exceptions thrown within the player proxies
/// and contains a facility for error and event logging.
/// Control parameters can be delivered via command-line or as
/// a config file, and new programm option can be dynamically added.
